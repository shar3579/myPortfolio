This project demonstrates how to implement **two stacks using a single array** in Java. It explains the stack data structure and its common operations, providing multiple methods of implementation, examples, and Java code.

## Features

- **Two Stacks in One Array**: Efficient use of array space for two stacks.
- **Space Efficient Method**: Avoid stack overflow using dynamic space allocation.
- **Java Implementation**: Complete Java code provided for better understanding.
- **Interactive Demo**: Visit the live demo for hands-on experience.

## Technologies

- **Java**: Programming language used to implement the project.
- **Data Structures**: Stack implementation and operations.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosted the interactive demo online.

## Live Demo

Visit the website for an interactive demo: [Interactive Two Stacks Web](https://shar3579.github.io/Interactive-Two-Stacks-Web/).

## Getting Started

To understand this project, you can begin by reviewing the concepts of stacks and their operations. The following steps describe how to implement two stacks in one array:

### Equal Division of Array

This method divides the array into two equal halves, allocating each half to one stack.

### Space Efficient Method

This method allows both stacks to grow dynamically from opposite ends of the array.

## Java Code Implementation

Here is the basic structure of the Java implementation:

```java
class TwoStacks {
    private int arr[];
    private int size;
    private int top1, top2;

    // Constructor
    TwoStacks(int n) {
        size = n;
        arr = new int[n];
        top1 = -1;
        top2 = size;
    }

    // Push operation for the first stack
    void push1(int x) {
        if (top1 < top2 - 1) {
            top1++;
            arr[top1] = x;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Stack Overflow");
        }
    }

    // Push operation for the second stack
    void push2(int x) {
        if (top1 < top2 - 1) {
            top2--;
            arr[top2] = x;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Stack Overflow");
        }
    }

    // Pop operation for the first stack
    int pop1() {
        if (top1 >= 0) {
            int x = arr[top1];
            top1--;
            return x;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Stack Underflow");
            return -1;
        }
    }

    // Pop operation for the second stack
    int pop2() {
        if (top2 < size) {
            int x = arr[top2];
            top2++;
            return x;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Stack Underflow");
            return -1;
        }
    }
}

```
