The MRI Brain Tumor Detection Model is a simple yet effective deep learning model designed to detect brain tumors from MRI scan images. This project serves as a foundational version with significant potential for improvement through more advanced architectures and techniques.

## Features

- **CNN-Based Classification**: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify MRI scans into tumor and non-tumor categories.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses image data to ensure model accuracy.
- **High Accuracy**:  Achieved 99.2% validation accuracy on 7023 MRI images.
- **Performance Visualization**: Built as a straightforward implementation with scope for enhancement.



## Technologies

-  **TensorFlow/Keras**: Core deep learning framework.
-  **OpenCV**: Image preprocessing and augmentation.
-  **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
-  **Python**: Programming language.

## Getting Started

To get started with the MRI Brain Tumor Detection Model, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python (v3.8 or later)
- pip


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone "https://github.com/shar3579/mri-brain-tumor-classifier.git"
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib numpy
   ```

3. Load the saved model:
   ```bash
   new_model = load_model(os.path.join('models','imageclassifier.h5'))
   ```

4. Input an MRI Scan of Brain after saving it in your local machine (check the jupyter file for reference):
   ```bash
   new_model.predict(np.expand_dims(resize/255, 0))
   ```

5. Check the Result

## Model Overview

The model uses a CNN architecture with multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and dense layers for classification. It processes MRI images to distinguish between images with tumors and those without.

### Model Performance

- **Precision**: 98.9%
- **Recall**: 99.6%
- **Accuracy**: 99.2%

## Future Scope

- **Incorporating Transfer Learning**: Enhance accuracy by using pre-trained models like InceptionV3 or ResNet.
- **Implementing Web Interface**: Develop a user-friendly web application for real-time predictions.
- **Dataset Expansion**: Include more diverse MRI datasets to improve generalization.
- **Model Optimization**: Explore techniques like dropout, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning.
